The audio in this timer is from [this popular video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koMp3ei4xJw&ab_channel=EziBoteach).

The song is "Flower" from the album Play (1999) by Moby.

"Bring Sally Up" is actually a misheard lyric:

> Green Sally up, Green Sally down
>
> Last done squat gotta tear the ground
>
> ...
>
> Old Miss Lucy's dead and gone
>
> Left me here to weep and moan
